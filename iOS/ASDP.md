### Responsibility
In this project Anang has responsibility to build and develop iOS Application.

### Methodology
For this project Anang use Swift as Programming Language and using Storyboard to implement design in program. ASDP boat ticket was developed in waterfall metodology because they already had system, so we just develop mobile platform from scratch but not on the whole system.

### Challenge
Public Application has their goals and user as a real tester. There are many possiblities when application is published and be used by user with various device. In this case Anang must know real condition as soon as possible. So Anang using analytic report library to know all of error that happened in release environment, so it can be fixed before happen in many users.
