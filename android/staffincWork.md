## Contribution
### Responsibility
In this project Anang got responsibility to develop and build Android platform from scratch. Anang also has responsiblity to enhance the quality and update the feature of the application to keep relevant with business requirement.

### Methodology
For this project Anang and team using agile metodology to develop the system. Because it was a new concept so there are many changes happened in development process. Agile will match with this requirement. In a big picture what Anang doing are : 
- Pra-production meeting before development process,
- Develop Android Application based on user requirement and design,
- Collaboration with team on developed application
- Manual Testing and Fix failed case before deployment
- Troubleshoot and debugged to optimize performance

### Challenge
The Challenge in this project is the changes happened too fast. Sometime what has been deployed last week should change because user doesn't need it. With that pace is too hard to change the code especially because it doesn't implemented clean code yet. So with that condition, Anang has to migrate little by little piece of code architecture and structure, so for the next time the changes will easier to handle
